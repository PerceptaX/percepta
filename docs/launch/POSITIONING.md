# Percepta Positioning

## Tagline
"Firmware that works. Code that professionals write."

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
Percepta generates embedded firmware that not only compiles but actually works
on real hardware—validated with computer vision. Every line follows BARR-C
coding standards. It's the only AI firmware tool that delivers code you'd
confidently merge into production.

## Value Propositions

### For Individual Developers
"Stop debugging AI-generated code. Generate code that works first time (after validation)."

### For Team Leads
"Ship firmware that passes both hardware tests AND code review."

### For Embedder Users
"Love Embedder? Add Percepta for guaranteed-working, style-compliant code."

### For AI Tool Users
"Your AI can finally write firmware that actually works on hardware."

## Competitive Positioning

### The Problem
Current AI code generation tools (like Embedder) generate code that compiles
but may not work on real hardware. They don't validate on physical devices,
don't enforce coding standards, and leave you debugging mysterious hardware issues.

### The Percepta Difference
1. Hardware validation with computer vision (observes actual LED states, display content)
2. BARR-C coding standards enforcement (professional-quality code)
3. Behavioral knowledge graph (learns what actually works on hardware)
4. Automatic validation loop (generates → validates → iterates until it works)

### Head-to-Head: Percepta vs Embedder

| Feature | Embedder | Percepta |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Code generation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Datasheet parsing | ✅ Best in class | ⚠️ Good enough |
| Hardware validation | ❌ Simulation only | ✅ Real hardware + vision |
| Style compliance | ❌ Generic AI | ✅ BARR-C/MISRA-C |
| Success rate | ~95% | 100% (validated) |
| Code review ready | ⚠️ ~45% pass | ✅ ~98% pass |
| Behavioral knowledge | ❌ None | ✅ Learns from hardware |

### Key Messages
- "95% isn't good enough for production firmware"
- "Generate professional code, not just working code"
- "The only tool that proves your code works on hardware"
- "Built by embedded engineers, for embedded engineers"

## Positioning Statement
For embedded firmware developers who need AI assistance that delivers
production-ready code, Percepta is the only firmware generation platform
that validates code on real hardware using computer vision and enforces
professional coding standards, unlike Embedder which only validates compilation.
