# Percepta Positioning

## Tagline
"Firmware that works. Code that professionals write."

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
Percepta generates embedded firmware that not only compiles but actually works
on real hardware—validated with computer vision. Every line follows BARR-C
coding standards. It's the only AI firmware tool that delivers code you'd
confidently merge into production.

## Value Propositions

### For Individual Developers
"Stop debugging AI-generated code. Generate code that works first time (after validation)."

### For Team Leads
"Ship firmware that passes both hardware tests AND code review."

### For Embedder Users
"Love Embedder? Add Percepta for guaranteed-working, style-compliant code."

### For AI Tool Users
"Your AI can finally write firmware that actually works on hardware."

## Competitive Positioning

### The Problem
Current AI code generation tools (like Embedder) generate code that compiles
but may not work on real hardware. They don't validate on physical devices,
don't enforce coding standards, and leave you debugging mysterious hardware issues.

### The Percepta Difference
1. Hardware validation with computer vision (observes actual LED states, display content)
2. BARR-C coding standards enforcement (professional-quality code)
3. Behavioral knowledge graph (learns what actually works on hardware)
4. Automatic validation loop (generates → validates → iterates until it works)

### Head-to-Head: Percepta vs Embedder

| Feature | Embedder | Percepta |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Code generation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Datasheet parsing | ✅ Best in class | ⚠️ Good enough |
| Hardware validation | ❌ Simulation only | ✅ Real hardware + vision |
| Style compliance | ❌ Generic AI | ✅ BARR-C/MISRA-C |
| Success rate | ~95% | 100% (validated) |
| Code review ready | ⚠️ ~45% pass | ✅ ~98% pass |
| Behavioral knowledge | ❌ None | ✅ Learns from hardware |

### Key Messages
- "95% isn't good enough for production firmware"
- "Generate professional code, not just working code"
- "The only tool that proves your code works on hardware"
- "Built by embedded engineers, for embedded engineers"

## Positioning Statement
For embedded firmware developers who need AI assistance that delivers
production-ready code, Percepta is the only firmware generation platform
that validates code on real hardware using computer vision and enforces
professional coding standards, unlike Embedder which only validates compilation.
```

**Demo Script:**

```markdown
# Percepta Demo Script (5 minutes)

## Scene 1: The Problem (30 seconds)
"AI code generation tools like Embedder are great—they generate code from
datasheets in seconds. But there's a problem: does it actually work?"

[Show Embedder generating code]
"Embedder says this code should work. Let's flash it..."
[Show LED not blinking correctly]
"2Hz instead of 1Hz. Now I'm debugging AI-generated code."

## Scene 2: The Percepta Way (2 minutes)
"Percepta generates code AND validates it works on real hardware."

\`\`\`bash
percepta generate "Blink LED at 1Hz" --board esp32 --output blink.c
\`\`\`

[Show generation report with style validation]
"✓ BARR-C compliant, auto-fixes applied"

[Flash to hardware]

\`\`\`bash
percepta observe my-esp32
\`\`\`

[Show vision capturing LED blinking at 1.02 Hz]
"Percepta observes actual hardware behavior with computer vision."

## Scene 3: The Knowledge Graph (1 minute)
"Every validated pattern gets stored. The more you use Percepta, the smarter it gets."

\`\`\`bash
percepta generate "Toggle LED on button press" --board esp32
\`\`\`

[Show prompt retrieving similar validated patterns]
"It found 3 similar patterns that work on ESP32."

## Scene 4: Professional Code (1 minute)
"Code that looks like a senior engineer wrote it."

[Show generated code side-by-side with BARR-C checklist]
- Function names: Module_Function() ✓
- Types: uint8_t, uint16_t ✓
- No magic numbers ✓
- Const correctness ✓
- Doxygen comments ✓

## Scene 5: The Pitch (30 seconds)
"Percepta: Firmware that works. Code that professionals write."

"Get started free: github.com/Perceptax/percepta"
```

**Comparison Table (for website/docs):**

Create detailed feature comparison:
- Code generation quality
- Validation methods
- Style compliance
- Iteration loops
- Knowledge retention
- Pricing
- Use cases

Include benchmark results:
- Compilation rate: Embedder 100%, Percepta 100%
- Hardware success rate: Embedder ~95%, Percepta 100%
- Style compliance: Embedder ~45%, Percepta ~98%
- Time to working code: Embedder 10s, Percepta 45s (but guaranteed working)

**Demo Video Storyboard:**

Plan 5-minute demo video covering:
1. Introduction to problem (30s)
2. Live demo of percepta generate (2m)
3. Vision-based validation (1m)
4. Knowledge graph benefit (1m)
5. Code quality showcase (30s)

Include script, screen recordings needed, voiceover text.

AVOID: Attacking competitors directly. Focus on "we validate on hardware" not "they don't."
AVOID: Over-promising. Be honest about speed tradeoff (45s vs 10s) but emphasize quality.

# Announcing Percepta: AI Firmware Generation That Actually Works on Hardware

**TL;DR:** Percepta generates embedded firmware and validates it works on real
hardware using computer vision. Every line follows BARR-C coding standards.
Unlike other AI code generators, we prove your code works before you ship it.

## The Problem with AI-Generated Firmware

Current AI code generation tools are impressive—they can generate firmware from
natural language and datasheets in seconds. But there's a critical gap:
**they can't tell you if the code actually works on hardware**.

"Blink LED at 1Hz" might compile perfectly but blink at 2Hz because the timer
prescaler calculation is wrong for your specific board revision. Now you're
debugging AI-generated code.

## How Percepta Works

### 1. Generate Professional Code

\`\`\`bash
percepta generate "Blink LED at 1Hz" --board esp32 --output blink.c
\`\`\`

Percepta uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to generate firmware following BARR-C embedded
coding standards. Auto-fixes common violations like naming conventions and type safety.

### 2. Observe Hardware Behavior

\`\`\`bash
percepta observe my-esp32
\`\`\`

Point your camera at your board. Percepta uses computer vision to observe:
- LED states (ON/OFF, blinking frequency, color)
- Display content (LCD text via OCR)
- Boot sequences

### 3. Validate and Learn

Generated code that works gets stored in a behavioral knowledge graph. Future
generations retrieve similar validated patterns, making the tool smarter over time.

## Why This Matters

**For professionals:** Code review-ready output. BARR-C compliant, no magic
numbers, proper error handling, static allocation.

**For teams:** Validated patterns shared across your team. Company-specific
style guides enforced automatically.

**For hardware developers:** Stop debugging mysterious timing issues. Know your
code works before flashing to production hardware.

## Open Source & Free to Start

Percepta is open source (MIT license) and free for unlimited local usage.
Cloud HIL farm coming soon for validating on boards you don't own.

**Get started:**
\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Perceptax/percepta/releases/latest/download/percepta-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/percepta
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/percepta
percepta device add my-board --camera /dev/video0
percepta observe my-board
\`\`\`

**Documentation:** https://github.com/Perceptax/percepta/tree/main/docs

## What's Next

- **Phase 2:** Cloud HIL farm (validate on 50+ boards without owning them)
- **Phase 3:** Community code hub (hardware-verified pattern library)
- **Phase 4:** Enterprise features (team workspaces, SSO, private style guides)

## Built by Embedded Engineers

We've spent careers debugging silicon errata, fighting with datasheets, and
writing firmware that ships in products. AI code generation is powerful, but
only if it works on real hardware.

Try Percepta. Generate professional firmware. Validate everything.

**Hacker News Post:**

```markdown
Title: Percepta – AI firmware generation that validates on real hardware (github.com/perceptax)

Body:
I've been frustrated with AI code generation for embedded systems. Tools like
Embedder are impressive—they generate code from datasheets—but they can't tell
you if it actually works on hardware. You're left debugging mysterious timing
issues and silicon errata.

So I built Percepta: https://github.com/Perceptax/percepta

Key innovations:
- Generates BARR-C compliant firmware (professional coding standards)
- Validates on real hardware using computer vision (observes LEDs, displays)
- Learns from validated patterns (behavioral knowledge graph)
- Open source (MIT) and free for local usage

Demo: `percepta generate "Blink LED at 1Hz" --board esp32` generates code,
then `percepta observe my-esp32` uses your webcam to verify it blinks at 1Hz.

Looking for feedback from embedded developers. What workflows would benefit
from hardware validation?
